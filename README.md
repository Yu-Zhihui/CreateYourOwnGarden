## Project Structure

- main: The main part of the project includes:
    1. Arduino code for various components: ultrasonic sensors, servos and LEDs
    2. Interactive animations code: 2 formats (Processing and p5.js)
    3. Serial port connection code

- p5.serialport-main: p5.serialport is a serial port monitoring tool

- p5.serialserver-main: p5.serialserver is a server used to collect the serial port data

- port_test_basic: For testing the serial port of Arduino Uno microcontroller board

- serial_ultrasonic_test: For testing the ultrasonic connection

- serialtest: For testing the serial connection
